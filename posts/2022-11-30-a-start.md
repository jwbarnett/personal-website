I was reading on some comments section in Hacker News that writing a blog was worthwhile,
even if there's no intention for the content to be read - so here's me trying that. There're
a few things I've already considered writing about, but some technical stuff that needs to
be done with this site to make it blog-post ready first.

Realistically I think it's unlikely a lot of this will get done, but now I've made this
post and it's out on the Internet, hopefully it'll hold me somewhat accountable. Let's see...
