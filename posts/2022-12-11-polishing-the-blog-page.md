title: 'Polishing up the blog page'

Okay, so I've now got an indexed blog page! I'm using next.js which is pretty neat. One
day I'm hoping to just have a "meta" page which covers all the technology behind this site,
the photos, and anything else. For now though, I'm essentially treating this blog as a
commit or version log.

Some other things on the todo list:
* Clean up the page further and make it look nicer
* Swap some of the pages (blogs/photos) out to subdomains rather than paths
* Eventually write some actual blog posts
* Have more of a travel blog section for some of the photo sets to go over what/where things are

Hopefully I'll be able to cover at least a few of those over Christmas, but I make no promises.
