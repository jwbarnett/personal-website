title: 'Migrating to Next.js App Router'

While writing that last personal update blog post yesterday, I realised that
I was using an out of date version of Next.js - no surprise there given this
hadn't been touched for over a year. Over the course of this time, they'd
released a new way of routing - their App Router. Given that this is basically
a static website, it looks like there was no real benefit to making the switch,
but given the language on the Next.js website, it felt like the app router
would be receiving more of the attention in future updates. And who knows,
perhaps there'll be more dynamic content on here at some point.
