title: '[Personal] Some Updates'

Alrighty, so haven't really made much progress with this website for a while. I 
recently gifted myself a Raspberry Pi 5 with an NVMe drive, so I'm hoping to 
mess around a bit more with home networking and blog about it. I'm intending it
more as a guide for myself when I inevitably end up breaking it all rather than 
to be informative to anyone else.

At some point since the last post I moved this site, and all the others (except
the wedding one) to GitHub pages - turns out hosting basic stuff on completely
overprovisioned cloud infrastructure is noticably expensive. The wedding site
got moved to Next.js cloud hosing (which is free!), so I've essentially cut the
costs of running these pages to Â£0... For now...

In terms of personal updates - I've played a lot of video games, watched a lot
of TV, bought a pizza oven, consumed far too much pizza, started cycling for 
exercise, started reading books, gotten married. Yeah, quite a lot has happened 
I guess.

On the more technical side, I've switched from Windows to Fedora, and started 
making better use of my NAS. More on the NAS stuff in the future I'm hoping.

That's it for this mini personal update. More of just an "I'm back". Hopefully 
I'll have a more interesting and technical post coming up soon on the absolute 
mission it's been to even start getting my home networking and self hosted 
services into a reasonable place.

Also on the development of this site front - need to add some sort of tagging 
feature. Just prefixing with "[Personal]" doesn't quite cut it.
