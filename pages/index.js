        I'm a London based Software Engineer, currently working at the Department for Work
        and Pensions. My professional work has involved writing code in Java and Scala.

        In my spare time I try to keep somewhat fit - now by dabbling in cycling. I also try
        to take some nice photos when I get the opportunity.
